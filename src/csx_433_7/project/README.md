Welcome

This file introduces you to compscix-433.7 final project

### COMPSCI X433.7 - Machine Learning With TensorFlow

The completed project work can be found here:
https://github.com/sanatanonline/compscix-433-assignments/tree/master/src/csx_433_7/project

Once you go to this location, please read the instractions carefully and follow the steps to run the code. The following environments and libraries are used while writing and executing the code. If you use different versions of the software, the code might not work.

## platform/system and installation versions (pre-requisites to run the code)

All the codes above was developed and tested using the following software stack

**jupyter notebook 5.5.0

**numpy**: 1.14.3

**matplotlob**: 2.2.2

**tensorflow**: 1.8.0

**tensorboard**: 1.8.0

### dataset

The training and testing data set is large enough and we have not uploaded to the GitHub repository. To use the dataset, please go to the below URL and download the dataset as zip file.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzip the data and copy it to the folder "HAR_data". Please refer to the "load data" section of the python module if you find any issue loading the data.

### .py and .pynb code

We have tested and run the .py file. The notebook version is created for presentation. Althouh, the pynb file has same code as the .py file, but we have not tested it.
